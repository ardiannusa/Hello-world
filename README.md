# Hello-world

Hi Folks

My name is Ardian and I am currently a Senior at Babson College, concentrating in Entrepreneurship and Information Technology Management. On parallel with my coursework, I am taking a data science foundation class in Coursera to deepen my knowledge in Data Science and become a better R programmer. With that said, I am looking forward to develop new learnings in the course from the unique modules in coursera.
